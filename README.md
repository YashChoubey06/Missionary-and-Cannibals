# Missionary-and-Cannibals


This Python implementation solves the Missionaries and Cannibals problem using BFS. The challenge is to get three missionaries and three cannibals across a river using a boat that holds two people, without ever letting the cannibals outnumber the missionaries. Made by me :)
